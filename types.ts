// Public plugin contract for Shepherd's server-side, in-process plugin system

// plugins access core ONLY through the `PluginContext` (`ctx`) passed to `register`,
// never by importing core modules. Keeping every plugin call site behind `ctx` lets a
// future core swap the implementation (curated / permission-scoped / out-of-process)
// without touching plugin code. This file deliberately has NO imports so both the
// loader and the spawn path can depend on it cheaply.

   *  authenticated under that dir's account — e.g. to route review quota onto a pool account.
   *  Contract:
   *   - The dir MUST exist on host (it is hard-bound); a missing dir is ignored with a log and the
   *     spawn falls open to the active account.
   *   - Its `projects` subtree is transparently redirected to Shepherd's active projects dir so the
   *     reviewer transcript stays where usage/activity readback looks — the routed dir need not (and
   *     does not) accumulate transcripts.
   *   - The reviewer reads/writes ONLY this dir's own `.claude.json` (its `oauthAccount` is a
   *     cosmetic display field, not a login); the operator's `~/.claude.json` is never touched, so
   *     there is no identity cross-contamination or account-mismatch prompt.
   *   - Routing REQUIRES a sandbox backend: with no backend in api-key mode the credential-less
   *     mirror is kept (the patched dir's real OAuth creds would otherwise conflict with the key). */
